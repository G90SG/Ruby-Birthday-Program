# Ruby Birthday Program
What day of the week were you born on? Do you know?
Here's a way to find out.
For example, if your date of birth was 6 July 1989 :
D=6 , M=7 , and Y=1989
If M had been a 1 or 2, subtract 1 from Y and add 12 to M.
YF is made from the first two digits of Y and YL is made from the last two digits of Y.
To begin, work out the sum of all the integer parts of 2.6Mâˆ’5.39 , of YF4 , and of YL4
Add D and YL into that total, and then subtract 2 lots of YF
Divide that final answer by 7 and notice the remainder .
A remainder value of 0 means the date was a Sunday, 1 means it was a Monday, 2 for a
Tuesday, and so on.
